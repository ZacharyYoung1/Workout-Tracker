# Nosql: Workout Tracker

For this web app I have created a workout tracker. Using Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express, this app allows you to keep track of your workout stats!

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Usage

* Follow the prompts on the deployed application to log your workout!
* Navigate to "Dashboard" tab to view stats of your completed workouts!
